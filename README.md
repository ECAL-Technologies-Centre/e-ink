# e-ink

## Getting Started

#### Running a sketch on the Visionect Display
1. Download one of the example folders of the repository:
	- **empty_p5**: Ready to be used with p5.js.
	- **empty**: Ready to be used with vanilla htmlCanvas or other canvas libraries.
	- **ball**: Simple example running on p5.js.
2. Connect to the WiFi **ct-zotac-2**. Password: **ecalecal**.
3. Uncomment the line `Ink.connect ...` in the **sketch.js** file.
4. Run your example folder on a [localhost](https://flaviocopes.com/local-web-server/ "localhost").
5. ???
6. Profit.

#### Running multiple sketches with the *Visionect Sketch Selector*
1. Use the PC **zotac-2**. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on Chrome.
2. Select the sketch you want to display on the e-paper.

#### Running the sketch offline
1. Comment out the line `Ink.connect...`.

#### Changing the time
1. Click anywhere on the canvas. A popup will show the current time.
2. Click on any digits of `00:00:00`. Hours, minutes and seconds are changed indepedently. You can also drag them for fast incrementation.
3. Click outside the digits to close the popup.

## Troubleshoot

#### Cannot connect to ct-zotac-2
1. Make sure the PC Zotac-2 is ON. Zotac-2 is the second PC on the left row of the entry.
2. Go to *Settings  > Network & Internet > Mobile hotspot.*
3. Switch it on.

#### Connection error in the console.log of your sketch
1. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "localhost:3000") on Zotac-2.
2. If it doesn't work. You need to run the latest version of the Visionect Sketch Selector on zotac-2:
	1. Download the folder server of this repository.
	2. Navigate to the downloaded folder using the Command Prompt. Write `cd `+ the path to the folder). Press Enter.
	3. Write `npm install`. Press Enter. Wait.
	4. Write `node server.js`. Press Enter.
	5. Done. Confirm by going to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "localhost:3000").
3. Make sure only one Visionect Sketch Selector is running at the same time.

#### Still cannot connect to the Visionect Display.
1. Make sure the wifi ct-zotac-2 is on.
2. The display might be sleeping. Connect a USB-C to USB-A cable to the right port of the display. Plug it on a phone charger. You should hear a small bip noise.
3. From the PC zotac-2. Go to [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081 "localhost:8081") on a browser.
4. You should be connected to the Visionect Server. One device should be online.

#### Still having WTF issues.
Ask SÃ©batien Matos or Tibor Udvari for additionnal help.
